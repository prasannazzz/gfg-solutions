What this project does
----------------------
gfg-solutions is a personal collection of solved algorithmic problems sourced from GeeksforGeeks. Each problem typically includes:
- a short problem README (problem statement, constraints, examples),
- one or more solution files with implementations (most solutions in this repo are Java),
- optional explanatory comments or optimized variants.

Why this project is useful
--------------------------
- Learning reference: See clear implementations for common DSA problems (recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, etc.).
- Interview prep: Walk through problem statements and study reference solutions.
- Template code: Use tested algorithm templates as a starting point for your own implementations.
- Organization: Problems are grouped by difficulty which helps focus practice.

Repository structure
-------------------
Root layout (representative):
- README.md (this file)
- Difficulty: Easy/...
- Difficulty: Medium/...
- Difficulty: Hard/...
  - Each problem folder contains:
    - README.md — problem statement and examples
    - solution files — e.g., `palindromic-partitioning.java`, `matrix-chain-multiplication.java`

Example paths:
- Difficulty: Hard/Palindromic Partitioning/README.md
- Difficulty: Hard/Palindromic Partitioning/palindromic-partitioning.java

Getting started
---------------

Requirements
- Java JDK 11+ (many solutions are Java; other languages may be present)
- A text editor or IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse, etc.)
- Git for cloning the repository

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prasannazzz/gfg-solutions.git
cd gfg-solutions
